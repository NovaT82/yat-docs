# Yat integration support

ðŸ“– Help is just around the corner! ðŸ“–

## Discord

Join our huge community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/YgBM4S8kCk) and drop into the #api-support channel. There's
bound to be someone there that can help you.

## Email

Discord should be your go-to mechanism for help. But failing that, you can email your question to [support@y.at].

## YatExchange on Stack Exchange network.

There's no dedicated stack exchange server for yats (yet). ðŸ˜¢

But one day..
